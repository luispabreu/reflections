What happens when you initialize a repository Why do you need to do it?

A new .git file comes in. I need to do it in order to keep up with versions

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different in that the staging area is just transitory, it is not a real commit or repository, it is not a working directory. It offers the value to control what you want to follow in the commits 1
