How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It helped me to spot the difference by scaning the file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would help me make any changes faster and spot any bugs faster as well. It would allow me to code more freely and without being afraid of messing up.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

I think the pros are that you can actually decide when to do it.
The cons are: you can forget to do it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think that Git does that because it is oriented to coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I think I can use the commands git log to view all the history and git diff to view the differences :)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It will help me be more bold as I go forth coding

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To save different versions of my files 1
